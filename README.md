# Predictin Santander Customer Satisfaction
Predicting the satisfaction level of Santander customers using Apache Spark (PySpark).

Customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

In this project, we'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
